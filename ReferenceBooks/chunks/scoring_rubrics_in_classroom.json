    "content": "Standards, assessment, accountability, and grading-these are the issues that dominated discussions of education in the 1990s. Today, they are at the center of every modern education reform effort. As educators turn to the task of implementing these reforms, they face a complex array of questions and concerns that little in their background or previous experience has prepared them to address. This series is designed to help in that challenging task.\n\nIn selecting the authors, we went to individuals recognized as true experts in the field. The ideas of these scholar-practitioners have already helped shape current discussions of standards, assessment, accountability, and grading. But equally important, their work reflects a deep understanding of the complexities involved in implementation. As they developed their books for this series, we asked them to extend their thinking, to push the edge, and to present new perspectives on what should be done and how to do it. That is precisely what they did. The books they crafted provide not only cutting-edge perspectives but also practical guidelines for successful implementation.\n\nWe have several goals for this series. First, that it be used by teachers, school leaders, policy makers, government officials, and all those concerned with these crucial aspects of education reform. Second, that it helps broaden understanding of the complex issues involved in standards, assessment, accountability, and grading. Third, that it leads to more thoughtful policies and programs. Fourth, and most important, that it helps accomplish the basic goal for which all reform initiatives are intended-namely, to enable all students to learn excellently and to gain the many positive benefits of that success.\n\n> *-Thomas R.

    "content": "Have you ever been nervous about grading certain types of student work-like creative writing, a research report, or an oral presentation? Have you ever been anxious because your new state content standards said that students \"will think critically\" or will be \"life-long learners\" and you are not quite sure how to ensure that they become so or even if you'll know when it occurs? Have you ever given up on peer-review groups because it seems to be a waste of time-students make very superficial comments to each other and you're not sure what to do about it? Have you ever pulled your hair out at 11:00 at night because it's obvious in the papers you're grading that your students just don't get it?\n\nIf so, then this book is for you. It is intended as a practical guide to the development and use of scoring rubrics in the classroom to achieve three goals:\n\n- 1. Clarifying the targets of instruction, especially those that are complex and hard to define such as problem solving, writing, and group process skills\n- 2. Providing valid and reliable assessment of student learning on these same complex and hard-to-assess student outcomes\n- 3. Improving student motivation and achievement by helping students understand the nature of quality for performances and products\n\nConsider the four vignettes in Box P.l with these benefits in mind. Which scenarios will most likely lead to (a) reduced teacher anxiety about consistent and effective scoring of performance and (b) increased student confidence and achievement? Why?\n\n![](_page_9_Picture_7.jpeg)\n\n**BOX P.1** Vignettes",

    "content": "Two years ago, the five teachers in a high school science department worked together to develop a common scoring rubric for a labora-\n\n![](_page_10_Picture_4.jpeg)\n\ntory report. They pooled their collective wisdom and looked at actual samples of student lab reports. Over time, their thinking led them to a consideration of the role of lab reports in promoting the larger goals of student reasoning, science process skills, and communicating effectively in science. Eventually, these features appeared in the rubric as a way to track the development of these competencies in the context of lab reports. During the first week of each semester, the teachers distribute the rubric and review the criteria with the students to ensure that they clearly understand the important elements of a quality report and how their reports will be evaluated. Sample reports illustrating strong and weak performance on the criteria are discussed. The teachers have observed that the overall quality of student lab reports has improved since they all began using the same rubric consistently within the department.\n\n![](_page_10_Picture_6.jpeg)",

Mutual agreement on the important qualities of student products (e.g., lab report) and performances (e.g., oral presentation) enables more consistent evaluation since the performance criteria do not vary from teacher to teacher. This increases teacher and student confidence.\n- 2. When performance criteria are made public, there is no \"mystery'' as to the desired elements of quality or the basis for judging (and grading) student products and performances. Good-quality criteria provide clear instructional targets for teachers and learning targets for students. This also increases teacher and student confidence.\n- 3. Involving students in generating and using criteria for self- and peer assessment helps them \"get their minds around\" important elements of quality and use that knowledge to improve their own performance. This increases student motivation, confidence, and achievement.\n\nYou probably also identified Vignettes 2 and 4 as being much less conducive to teacher and student confidence and achievement.",

If we want students to take control of their own learning, they must know the criteria for quality.

Additionally, these experiences can breed a feeling of hopelessness in students, resulting in their giving up.\n\n(Additionally, the criteria have to be good.

The teachers, students, and parents loved the process because they could clearly see what it took to succeed. It also enabled teachers to focus instruction and reliably track student progress over time. Students amazed everyone by their ability to accurately self-assess and self-correct. Writing achievement was steadily improving.\n\nDuring the course of conversation about their successful project I asked the principal, \"Isn't this a great example of standards-based instruction?\" I wasn't grilling the principal, I was just excited about how their activities exemplified the best intentions of standards-based learning.\n\nThe principal's reply brought me up short. She said, \"What do you mean? We're just using the Six-Trait Model to teach and assess writing.\"\n\nIt became very apparent that, although this staff was successfully using a rubric to focus teaching and help students improve their writing performance, they may not have completely understood how their practice fits into the bigger picture of assessment and standards-based education. As a result, they may not have been able to fully justify nor explain to others what they were doing. Similarly, they may not have been fully able to generalize the use of rubrics to other content areas.",

While a variety of assessment methods are available, they fall into two broad categories: (1) selected-response/short-answer and (2) constructedresponse.\n\nWe're throwing these terms at you because they bear directly on the need for performance criteria-selected-response questions don't need performance criteria, but all constructed-response methods do.\n\nSelected-response (multiple choice, true-false, and matching) and shortanswer methods require that students select a response from a provided list or require that students supply a very brief answer. These formats are great and very useful! You can use them to efficiently assess students' knowledge of factual information, basic concepts, and simple skills. Since such assessment items typically have a correct or best response, student answers may be quickly and \"objectively\" scored as correct or incorrect (but see Box 1.1). The\n\n**BOX 1.1** Misconception Alert!\n\nThere is actually nothing \"objective\" about selected-response test questions except the scoring. Subjective judgments enter all the way through the development of selected-response questions-What content should be covered? What specific questions should be asked? How should these questions be worded? What incorrect choices should be included? So, the idea that somehow selectedresponse questions are more \"objective\" than constructedresponse questions is a common misconception.\n\nterm \"objective test items\" is sometimes used to describe selected-response assessment methods because the answers are \"objectively\" scored-they are either right or wrong; there is no middle ground.",

First, an important goal for students is to be able to apply knowledge and reasoning in meaningful, \"real world\" situations. Selected-response questions tend to assess knowledge and skills in isolated, decontextualized ways. If we want application to the real world, we need another assessment technique.\n\nSecond, there is no hope of even assessing certain kinds of important student learning outcomes in selected-response and shortanswer formats. Consider writing, oral communication, physical skills, reading rate, and soon.\n\nFor these types of outcomes, constructed-response assessments are the ticket. Constructed-response assessments include essay tests, which ask students to prepare a lengthy written response to a question. Constructedresponse assessments also include performance assessments where students construct a tangible product (written, visual, or three-dimensional) or perform a demonstration (drive, speak, work in a group, play an instrument) to show what they understand and can do. Since constructed-response assessments call for students to organize and use knowledge and skills to answer a question or complete a task, rather than to recall and recognize, they are more likely to reveal if students understand and can apply what they're learning.\n\nNow here's the fly in the constructed-response ointment. Student responses to constructed-response assessments cannot be scored using a simple answer key or machine. As you know, a human being must rely on his or her own observation and judgment to evaluate responses to these open-ended assessments because they result in a range of responses that reveal different strategies, varying degrees of sophistication, and different levels of proficiency.\n\nBecause of the need for humans to judge responses to constructedresponse assessments, these formats have been labeled \"subjective.\"",

Clearly defined criteria and scoring guides provide more than just evaluation tools to use at the end of instruction-they help clarify instructional goals and serve as teaching targets.\n\nEducators who have scored student work as part of a large-scale performance assessment at the district or state level often recognize this benefit. For example, educators using the Six-Trait Model for evaluating writing unanimously agree that the very process of assessing teaches a great deal about what makes writing successful. Raters have to internalize a set of criteria so thoroughly that they can be consistent both with themselves, over time, and with other raters. During the process of scoring hundreds of papers, raters see many examples of what good and poor writing looks like, and they learn to systematically analyze it to determine why it is good or poor. Stories from raters (see Box 1.6) indicate that, for many, this assessment experience marks the first time they truly feel confident that they can identify the features of effective writing, in large part because they have a systematic vocabulary for talking about these features. Teachers go back to the classroom much more confident about their day-to-day judgments of student work and their ability to teach students how to craft writing so that it is effective.\n\nHave you also noticed this?",

If you are like most other educators, your notion of what constitutes good quality in these areas is not as crystal clear as your notion of what you like in a restaurant or other things in daily life. And yet, as educators, we are being asked to ensure that students are critical thinkers, life-long learners, and so on.

Perhaps it's because we're used to assigning single grades for complex assignments, knowing what an 'A' looks like in our heads, but rarely 'putting it to paper' so that our students can see it as well. Perhaps the difficulty in writing scoring criteria also lies in the challenge of describing just what it really looks like to perform well, or better yet, to perform at a variety of levels of competency. Nevertheless, it is the use of rubrics as an indispensable part of the instructional process which completes the vital link between assessment and instruction. Until we invest the time discerning for ourselves what excellence in writing, or speaking, or dancing, or singing, or whatever looks like, we are unable to fully 'teach' our students to achieve at these levels.\"",

Rather than comparing students to each other, we define the nature of quality (performance criteria) and set performance standards (how good is good enough) as a basis for judging student achievement and progress.\n- The performance criteria and standards are made public so that everyone-students, teachers, parents, community members, and employers-are aware of the nature of excellence and what it takes to succeed. Students can see where they are, and teachers can tell parents how their children are progressing toward \"proficiency.\"\n\nPerformance criteria and rubrics associated with constructed response and performance assessments serve important functions in such standardsbased education:\n\n- Performance criteria help define the standards by specifying what one would look for as evidence that the standards have been achieved. In fact, some folks think the criteria are the final definition of a standard-what is in the rubric is what teachers will teach and what students will learn.\n- When made public, the performance criteria and scoring guides provide clear and consistent targets for students, parents, teachers, and others.\n\n![](_page_32_Picture_1.jpeg)",

Some of these can be very simple, like checklists or \"performance lists.\" Some of these need to be more complex in order to capture the nature of quality in the diversity of student work.\n\nWe use the term \"rubric\" for these more complex kinds of criteria. Good quality rubrics cover the essense of quality and carefully define levels of performance.\n\n**BOX 1.10** Benefits of Performance Criteria\n\n- 1. To help educators clarify the nature of complex learning targets so that they feel comfortable teaching to them\n- 2. To assess student progress and status in ways that are consistent across students, assignments, and time\n- 3. To improve student achievement by letting students in on the secret of the nature of quality\n- 4.

I While it is true that there are some choices to be made with respect to rubrics, and these choices come equipped with odd terminology, the choices really are relatively simple and logical.\n\nChoices boil down to use. What is the job at hand? What are you hoping a rubric will do for you? Is it to teach students the important aspects of a complex performance, or is it to get a quick overall estimate of group status? Is it to find out if students can apply a particular problem-solving strategy, or when given an open-ended problem, if they can bring whatever problem-solving resources to bear to come up with a good solution? Is it to certify student competence or enable students to track their own progress toward important learning outcomes?\n\nAll of these are legitimate uses of rubrics. Some types of rubrics are more efficient for certain uses than other types.\n\nAnd that's what we discuss in this chapter-What types of rubrics exist? What are the distinguishing features of each? What are their strengths and weaknesses? When should the different types be used?\n\nJust to keep the information straight, here's how the chapter is set up:\n\n- ? Each section outlines a choice to be made:\n- Holistic or analytical trait\n- Task specific or general\n- Number of score points possible\n- ~ For each choice, we include a picture (for those visual learners among us), a definition, examples, and guidance on use.\n- ~ References from research or other articulate authors to show why we give the advice we do.",

In essence, one combines all the important ingredients of a performance or product to arrive at an overall, single judgment of quality. An example of a holistic rubric is shown in Figure 2.1.\n\nNotice how the combining occurs in this example. To arrive at an overall quality judgment, the rater would consider mathematical understanding, problem solving sophistication, *and* quality of communication all together, mentally weigh them, and decide on a single score that best describes the overall performance.\n\nAn *analytical trait* rubric divides a product or performance into essential traits or dimensions so that they can be judged separately-one *analyzes* a product or performance for essential *traits.* A separate score is provided for each trait. An example of an analytical trait rubric is provided in Figure 2.2.\n\nIn this example, writing performance is examined on each of six traits: (1) ideas, (2) organization, (3) voice, ( 4) word choice, (5) sentence fluency, and (6) conventions. Different traits could get different scores. For example, a piece ofwritingmightreceive a \"3\" for ideas (trait#1), and a \"5\" for use of conventions (trait #6), and so on. This reveals a profile of strengths and weaknesses in a piece of work.\n\nJust to be clear, there *are* holistic rubrics for writing. What's in them?

Each type has strengths and limitations.\n\nHolistic rubrics are well-suited for the following purposes:\n\n- Judging simple products or performances-ones that really don't have more than one trait of importance, such as reading fluency or response to an essay question asking about knowledge of the potassium cycle in the cell\n- Getting a quick snapshot of overall quality or achievement and thus are often used in large-scale assessments (national, state, or district levels) to quickly evaluate a large number of student responses\n- Judging the \"impact\" of a product or performance (e.g., to what extent was the essay persuasive? did the play entertain?). Examples of this are the NAEP writing rubrics in the Resource section. The NAEP provides a separate, holistic rubric for three types of writing-narrative, persuasive, and expository (see definition in Box 2.2). Each rubric is intended to score the overall success of the piece of writing in accomplishing its primary purpose. How well is a story told (narrative)? How well does a piece persuade (persuasive)? Or how well does a piece explain (expository)?\n\nBut, despite these advantages, holistic rubrics have their downside:\n\n• There is no detailed analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of a product or performance. So, they're not as useful diagnostically to help plan instruction. Nor do they provide students with detailed feedback to guide their improvement.

So, she would point out everything that made a passage sound less than optimum-bowing a little too close to the bridge or not parallel to the bridge; playing the\n\npassage in second position rather than in first; leading with the thumb; paying attention to a couple of the notes that are fuzzy; pressing down more on the bow at a particular point in the passage, and so on. I would much rather have had her tell me the two things to work on first.\n\nViolin playing is a complex performance. It needs to be broken down into doable components that can be practiced separately before they can be combined into the final product. For example, it is extremely useful to practice in the following manner. First, just concentrate on keeping the bow straight-don't worry about your wrist or if the notes are in tune . Then just concentrate on keeping a straight wrist-don't worry about your bow or the notes being in tune. Next, just concentrate on the notes-don't worry about your wrist or bow. Finally, try all three things together.\n\n> has demonstrated strong idea development (\"4\") and weak use of conventions (\"2\"), or vice-versa?

By the next bucket of balls he had introduced one more skill for the day . . . no more. Before a few weeks were out, he had quietly attended to my feet, grip, shoulder level, and follow through.

You don't have to! You can pick and choose the traits that make the most sense for individual assignments. For example, you might want to spend two weeks working just on the trait of \"voice.\" Or, you might spend the first half of the semester teaching students the traits one by one. You would only begin scoring work on those traits after they've been taught. Or, you might find that \"ideas\" and \"organization\" are especially important for a particular assignment. Great! If so, you can weight them more heavily.\n\nRubrics are a tool.

Task-Specific Rubric: Student Olympics SOURCE: National Assessment of Educational Progress, 1992.\n\n> We can hear you thinking, \"Why do I need to know this?\" Actually, the distinction is essential, based, again, on intended use. If our main goal is scoring (generating a number), then task -specific rubrics might be easier to use. However, if our goal is to teach students about the nature of quality, then generic rubrics are more effective.\n\n*Here's why most teachers find generic rubrics useful:*\n\n• You don't need to develop (or learn) a new rubric for each task. Developing a quality rubric is difficult and time consuming. Given the frenzied life of most teachers, the thought of creating a rubric for each and every open-ended assignment or performance task is daunting, to say the least.\n\n• Sometimes, you *can't* develop a new rubric for each task. When students are assembling portfolios, for example, they frequently select different pieces of work to demonstrate particular skills. Task-specific scoring would require a new rubric for every single piece of work. That would be inefficient and unnecessary.",

    "content": "The National Assessment of Educational Progress ran into this problem in 1992. Before this time, they gave several specific writing prompts (topics) to students and scored them using task-specific rubrics. In 1992 they decided to ask students to self-select papers from their daily classroom work to supplement their standardized writing sample. Oops, can't do task-specific scoring-there are too many different topics. The result? The three generic rubrics in the Resource section.\n\n• Generic rubrics are useful to help students understand the nature of quality-the \"big picture\" details that contribute to the quality of a type of performance or product. Task-specific rubrics only allow students to see what quality looks like in a single problem-the one at hand. The goal with generic rubrics is to help students see what quality looks like across similar tasks.\n\nGeneral = generalize. We want students to apply what they learned about quality in one task to the next task-we want them to generalize. It is easier for students to learn a general rubric that can be applied to a number of similar tasks, such as an oral report or scientific investigation, than to try to figure out a new rubric for each task.\n\nIn fact, we remember a high school social studies teacher who began with task-specific rubrics and then realized that she was putting the same general things in the rubric over and over again. Voila! General traits emerged.",

This promotes \"reliable\" assessment across teachers, making subjective assessment more objective. In fact, rather than having teachers create their own rubrics independently, some schools or districts are supporting teachers to develop generic rubrics for collective use. Such a practice establishes a \"standard\" set of criteria and performance levels for classroom assessment, leading to greater consistency among teachers.\n- It makes no sense to show task-specific criteria to students ahead of time because they \"give away'' the answer.\n- What happens if a student comes up with a perfectly reasonable strategy or solution, but it isn't one included in the task-specific criteria? Have you ever been going fast through papers, using the scoring guide in the textbook and not really thinking about what you are doing? Sometimes, students can come up with perfectly reasonable answers, but you don't notice it. In fact, a personal communication from a major test publisher indicated that this is the reason why they are moving away from task-specific scoring-sometimes, students come up with reasonable responses, but they are marked incorrect because they are not in the task-specific rubric.\n\nSo, *why would anyone want to use a task-specific rubric?* There are some circumstances where you'll want to use them.",

It's easier to train a group of people to base scores on the presence or absence of, say, three specific facts than to train them to judge the extent to which students \"understood the problem.\" Therefore, task-specific rubrics tend to be used in large-scale and \"high stakes\" contexts, such as state-level accountability assessments. So, if your main goal is to generate numbers, do task-specific scoring. It keeps costs down.\n- Sometimes, you want to know whether students know particular facts, equations, methods, or procedures. Do students notice the three important sources of experimental error in a particular science experiment? Can students apply a specific algorithm in mathematics? Are students effectively using a particular painting technique in art? These specific features could be listed in the rubric descriptors for a particular task. So, task-specific scoring could happen in mathematics, social studies, science, and any class that has a particular content to be learned.\n\n• In fact, in some circumstances you might want to have a combination oftask-specific features and a generic trait or two. For example, consider a fitness plan in a high school health class. The teachers decided to look for the presence or absence of specific knowledge and relationships between ideas-task-specific components in a rubric.

It's the specific comments such as \"the student started out well but seemed to get lost in the middle\" rather than the general comments such as \"logical\" that will be most helpful. Continually challenge yourself to \"say more about that\" or \"what specific things done by the student were cues that the student used a logical process?\" Continually challenge yourself to think beyond general words such as \"voice,\" \"perceptive,\" and \"good communication.\" Students don't understand what is meant by those words. Since the criteria are supposed to increase student understanding of the features of quality, we need to be clear on the indicators in the work that cue our judgments of quality. Also, challenging yourself to \"identify the specific indicators in the student work that made me judge it logical\" causes you to refine your own understanding of what you mean by these terms (but see Boxes 3.3 and 3.4).\n\nThinking about grading while placing work in stacks has an added benefit-it clarifies the connection between grades and the features of student work that earn the grade, thereby removing some of the subjectivity from grading.\n\n**BOX3.3** CAUTION! Negative Wording\n\nSometimes this procedure leads to very negative phrases at the low end of the scale, such as \"clueless\" and \"totally wrong.\" One way to avoid this is to think about the comments you would actually make to students when you hand back work-make \"I\" statements, such as \"I was confused as to what you did\" and \"I would like to know more about why you used the numbers you did.\"",

For example, you might note that in a strong response the student \"adds up the numbers for the two kinds of fruit and then subtracts the number of students.\"\n\nThis is good! Sometimes we want task-specific criteria, and sometimes we want general criteria. Generating both when sorting work really helps one to see and understand the difference.",

    "content": "The sorting process used thus far in this exercise is \"holistic.\" Participants end up with a list of comments for high, medium, and low performance; any single paper gets only one overall score.\n\nUsually during the listing of comments someone will say something to the effect that \"I had trouble placing this paper into one stack or another because it was strong on reasoning but weak on communication.\" This provides an excellent teachable moment to bring up the *reasons for analytical trait scoring*  systems-scoring each student work sample along more than one dimension. The reasons are that (a) it better shows a profile of student strengths and weaknesses, (b) it assists students to be better able to discuss their own work, and (c) novices often can't improve all parts of the performance at one timethis helps break the performance down into teachable segments. Besides, we, as teachers, feel more comfortable being able to commend students for the strengths in their work, even if there are also some weaknesses.\n\nTo develop \"traits\" (important dimensions of performance), you can identify comments on the brainstormed list that seem to go together and indicate which comments relate to each trait at the high, middle, and low levels. For example, people frequently see the traits of communication, problem solving/ reasoning, mathematical understanding, and correct computation when sorting math work (see Figure 3.2). Number these traits 1, 2, 3, and 4. Then go through your comments and place them into the categories. Put the trait number next to each comment on the brainstormed list.",

Just keep going until you are comfortable that you have an agreed -on list of key traits and attributes.\n\nThen compare your list of valued features to local or state content standards that correspond to the type of work sorted. What similarities do you find? There are always lots of overlaps-after all, the content standards were developed to represent the outcomes we all value for students.

Please notice that the definitions of the metarubric traits used in the text below are also reproduced in Figure 4.1. We did this in case you want to copy the metarubric (Figure 4.1) for use when you are evaluating the quality of the rubrics you are using.\n\nThe rubric for rubrics is analytical, consisting of four traits-Content, Clarity, Practicality, and Technical Soundness. It uses a 3-point scale, where 3 =\"ready to roll,\" 2 =\"on its way but needs revision,\" and 1 =\"not ready for prime time.\"\n\nPlease note that this metarubric was developed for classroom assessments, not for large-scale assessments. Although many of the features for large-scale assessment rubrics would be the same, some traits might need to be modified, added, or deleted for this use.\n\n*(text continues on* p. 52)",

Therefore, it is essential that the rubric cover all essential aspects that define quality in a product or performance and leaves out all things trivial.\n\nIf a rubric contains things other than those that really distinguish quality, teachers won't buy into them, students will not learn what really contributes to quality, and you might find yourself having to score down work that you feel in your heart is strong or give good ratings to work you feel in your heart is weak.\n\nWhen evaluating a rubric for content, ask yourself these questions: Can I explain why each thing I have included in my rubric is essential to a quality performance? Can I cite references that describe the best thinking in the field on the nature of quality performance? Can I describe what I left out, and why I left it out? Do I ever find performances or products that are scored low (or high) that I really think are good (or bad)? Is this worth the time devoted to it?",

It is not the case that only the things listed under each level have to be present, and if each thing is checked off then the rubric moves to a higher level.

Not all the indicators have to be present-it depends on the way the rubric will be used. The score scale in the metarubric should be seen as describing the sorts of things that are true of rubrics of various levels of quality.

A weak score means that the rubric needs so much work that it probably isn't worth the effort-it's time to find another one. It might even be easier to begin from scratch.

Rubric content truly is the final definition of content standards because the rubric describes what will \"count.\" Regardless of what is stated in content standards, curriculum frameworks, or instructional materials, the content of the rubric is what teachers and students will use to determine what they need to do in order to succeedwhat they see is what you'll get. Therefore, it is essential that the rubric cover all essential aspects that define quality in a product or performance and leave out all things trivial.\n\nIf a rubric contains things other than those that really distinguish quality, teachers won't buy into them, students will not learn what really contributes to quality, and you might find yourself giving ratings to work that you feel in your heart are too high or too low. So, when evaluating a rubric for content, ask yourself these questions:\n\n- Can I explain why each element I have included in my rubric is essential to a quality performance?\n- Can I cite references that describe the best thinking in the field on the nature of quality performance?\n- Can I describe what I left out, and why I left it out?\n- Do I ever find performances or products that are scored low (or high) that I really think are good (or bad)? If so, my rubric needs to be finetuned to cover that which is really important.\n- Is anything in the rubric not worth the time devoted to it?\n\nBox 4.1 tells stories of times when the content of a rubric was counterproductive to learning. Have you ever experienced situations similar to these?",

The oral presentations were to be between 2 and 3 minutes in length. The son practiced at home and timed his speech at about 2 minutes and 15 seconds. When he gave his oral presentation at school he was a little nervous and spoke faster. His presentation was logged in at 3 seconds under 2 minutes. He was docked two grades for length, from an A to a C.\n\nThe point? It might be desirable to have a 2-minute speech, but is this really what is most important in an oral presentation? What message does this send to the students? If length really *is* important, maybe this could be handled by a checklist (v' = right length). Then use more important criteria to give feedback on quality.\n\n*leaving Out Important Aspects of Writing*\n\nSome state-level writing assessments leave Voice and Word Choice out of their criteria for scoring writing. Their rationale is understandable-they feel that raters couldn't be consistent in their judgment of voice or word choice.\n\nHere's the problem: What impact do you suppose this omission has had on writing instruction in these states? The point is clear: What we assess signals what we value. What we judge with a rubric is what gets taught. Therefore, rubric content needs to reflect what we *really value* when judging quality. What they see is what you'll get.",

To score the essay, the rater first counts up the total number of grammatical errors. Then the rater counts up the number of \"fatal\" grammatical errors-those that are so confusing that meaning is lost. The number offatal errors is divided by the total number of errors to get the error index. An error index greater than 75% indicates the need for remediation.\n\nFigure 4.2. Informal Writing Assessment Rubric\n\nStudents are asked to write a research report on the originall3 colonies. To get an \"A,\" students must do the following:\n\n- Answer all the questions for each colonial region-Where were the colonies located? Who settled each region of colonization? Why did people come to each region? How did people live in each region?\n- Use a five-paragraph theme format (introduction, three paragraphs for the body, and a conclusion).\n- Have readable cursive writing.\n\nFigure 4.3.

It has been embraced and used nationwide to teach and assess writing in the classroom.\n\nThis doesn't, however, mean that it is perfect. Every good rubric is constantly under development to continue to home in on just that which most distinguishes quality. For example, the trait of \"sentence fluency\" began its life as \"sentence correctness.\" Teachers began having questions about this trait when they encountered sentence fragments that worked very well (in fact, were crafted by the author) to create a feeling in a piece of writing. A sentence fragment is not a complete sentence, and so the student's work had to be scored low on the trait of sentence correctness.\n\nThe solution? (Please note the sentence fragment.) Modify the trait of \"sentence correctness\" to \"sentence fluency.\" What we're really looking for is that *students are in control* of sentence structure-they can use complete sentences when they are needed, or they can intentionally use fragments when they add to the feel of the piece. Box 4.3 summarizes this common pitfall.",

Sometimes you can be perfectly clear on one page. Sometimes it takes six pages, as with the Six-Trait Model in Writing. The more complex the skill or product being defined, the more need for detail (and, therefore, length). After all, it's the hardest things to define, like problem solving, critical thinking, and lifelong learning, that *most* need to be defined. It's unlikely that satisfactory clarity for complex skills and products can fit on one page.\n\nBut that's not the only point. Additionally, detail helps clearly communicate to students what they need to do to produce quality work. Students have a harder time generating another strong response if they don't know what made the previous response strong. Or if the previous response is weak, they have a harder time making the next one better if they don't know what made the current one weak.\n\nTherefore, purpose is related to design. If the purpose of the criteria is use as an instructional tool in the classroom, then adequate detail is of paramount importance.

You could ask students to \"re-create\" (or add to) the criteria for quality by looking at previous samples of student job applications and video clips of interviews.\n- 2. One could ask students to critique the job applications or video clip interviews of other students.\n- 3. One could ask students to practice, with feedback from the teacher and their peers.\n- 4. One could ask students to keep track of their performance over time and analyze how first attempts are different from current attempts.\n- 5. Students could report the analysis in Item 4 to others.\n\nThese procedures would help students see and understand the intended achievement targets, practice hitting the targets, and self-assess. They would probably also help the students be more confident in the job interview and knowledgeably discuss the criteria by which they will be judged.\n\nThe rubric thus has potential for student self-use but needs some tweaking-streamlining and making the format more appealing.",

We've changed our minds. Developing rubrics is certainly important-they define what we mean by quality. But rubrics are not truly complete until we decide on the \"performance standard\" -the level of performance on the rubric that we'll call \"meeting standard\" or \"being competent.\"\n\nSetting \"performance standards\" is a cornerstone of standards-based education. For example, say you have a 6-point scale for assessing mathematics (like the California example in Figure 2.1 and the Resource section). Well, how good does performance have to be on this rubric at Grade 3, Grade 6, Grade 8, and Grade 11 in order for us to feel that students are either progressing adequately toward competency on the standard (Grades 3, 6, and 8) or have met the standard (Grade 10 or 11)? Is it a 3? A4? A 5?\n\nSetting performance standards on rubrics is not taking place just on district, state, and national assessments. The classroom parallel to setting performance standards is grading (see Box 5.1). What level of performance earns an\"/\\' in your classroom? How do you decide where on the rubric a \"C\"\n\nshould be? In both large-scale assessments and the classroom, the same question must be answeredhow good is good enough?\n\nIn this chapter, we outline several methods used in large-scale assessments for setting the \"official\" performance standards on rubrics. These methods are applicable to the\n\n**BOX** 5.1 Misconception Alert!\n\nSetting performance standards on a rubric doesn't only occur at the large-scale state and national levels. The classroom equivalent is grading-how do you convert rubric scores to grades? How good is good enough to get an \"/\\'? A \"B\"? An \"F\"?",

Children outside these \"normal\" ranges might cause red flags to be raised.\n\nNow, let's look at the same thing only with an absolute rubric scale. Let's say that you are using an absolute rubric scale of 6 points for writing. A \"3\" at Grade 4 would mean exactly the same thing as a \"3\" at Grade 11-the quality of the writing would look the same. To get a \"3\" in writing at Grade 3, the writing would have to be the same as a \"3\" in writing at Grade 11. If you mixed up the papers and didn't tell raters which grade was which, the papers would still get the same scores.

In this case, a \"4\" at Grade 3looks different from a \"4\" at Grade 11. To get a \"4\" at Grade 11, the work would have to be better. The score a paper would get is relative to the grade level-a piece of work that you might consider good if produced by a third grader, you might consider fairly weak if produced by a tenth grader.\n\nFor example, consider the state of Oregon. The same rubric is used in Grades 3-12 for reading, writing, oral communication, group work, and so forth. What changes are the anchor performances used to illustrate the score points at each grade level. In Oregon, a \"competent\" performance might always be a \"4,\" but a \"4\" atGrade3looksdifferentfroma \"4\" at Grade 11. Oregon and lots of other places use this approach because teachers tend to like it. They like having lots of score points to use at each grade level, while still taking grade level into account.",

To really tackle this issue and offer concrete suggestions about converting rubric scores to grades, we need to come to grips with some fundamental issues about grading, rubrics, and the\n\nrelationship between the two.\n\nWhat does a letter grade (A, B, etc.) represent? What should go into a grade? Do you agree that a grade should represent only level of achievement? Or should we also include motivation, trying hard, getting work in on time, finishing all the homework, and all the other things that sometimes get factored in?\n\nWhat does a score on a rubric represent? A rubric score indicates only achievement. It is a symbolic representation of a performance level, which is defined by the descriptors for that level.\n\nHow are these related? If we agree that grades should primarily communicate achievement and that a grade should include only information about achievement, then grades and rubric scores are indeed very closely related. If we don't agree that grades should only reflect achievement and be used to communicate, then we'll have trouble factoring rubric scores into grades.\n\nAssuming that we agree that grades should primarily communicate about achievement and that a grade should include only information about achievement, quality rubrics that truly describe progress could replace grades. Rubrics that have rich descriptors of various levels of achievement illustrated with actual samples of student work would communicate achievement even better than a grade.",

We shouldn't eliminate grades until we're sure we have something better (understood and embraced by all) to replace them. If you want a public relations nightmare, try\n\n**BOX5.2** Misconception Alert!\n\nThe best way to convert a rubric score to a grade is to add up all the points the student earned and divide by the total number of points possible. This percentage can be directly converted to a grade using standard percentage conversion systems. Wrong! replacing grades with rubrics or student-led parent conferences before all teachers are adept at using these things.\n\nSo, given that we'll likely be using grades for awhile, here's our best advice about how to proceed in generating letter grades from rubrics. (Box 5.2 states what *notto* do.)\n\nLet's assume that a student has received the following rubric scores, shown in Table 5.2, on eight written assignments using the Six-Trait Model.\n\nLooking at Agatha's pattern of scores, what grade do you think she earned? How did you\n\ndetermine this grade? What considerations do you have?\n\nThe tempting thing to do is to add up all the points (in this case, 165) and divide by the number of points possible (in this case, 8 papers x 6 scores x 5 points= 240).

But such pronouncements are pretty useless unless we provide some actual examples of how it looks in the classroom when teachers and students are using rubrics and criteria to improve learning.\n\nThis chapter is devoted to the premise that performance criteria and rubrics can be powerful instructional tools for improving the very achievement that is also being assessed. Instruction and learning is the important link-the \"so what\" of all the rest-the reason why we're spending all this time on performance criteria and rubrics in the first place. The idea is simple-teach students the criteria for quality and how to apply them to their own work to make it better.\n\nWe begin with a discussion of what it takes to \"know\" criteria and then present seven practical strategies to assist students to \"know\" and understand criteria as a means of improving their achievement.\n\nRemember the story in Chapter 1 about the conversation with the DMV in Washington State? That example illustrated the importance of knowing the criteria by which we are judged. And now for the rest of the story ...\n\nSo, what does it take to know criteria for the driver's examination?

Read a couple of age-appropriate (short) books to the students. After each book ask them if this gives them any additional ideas on what makes writing good. Add these to the list on the board.\n- 3. Read a couple of anonymous student papers from last year, or use The Redwoods and Fox in Figure 6.4. Ask students to work in groups to decide which is the better paper. Have them list the reasons why they like one paper better than the other. Add their comments to the list on the board.\n- 4. Tell the students that they have a pretty good list of features and ask them if they'd like to see what teachers value in writing.\n- 5. Show students lists of teacher comments (Figure 6.5) and how similar they are to the students'. Students are always amazed at the similarity of the lists. For many of them, this is the first hint that they can also \"be in on\" the secret of the characteristics of quality.\n- 6. Tell students that this year you're going to teach them how to look for and use the same criteria for quality writing that teachers use when they grade writing.\n\nFigure 6.3.

They didn't know what features to look for in work to comment on. And, even if they did notice something, maybe they lacked the vocabulary for talking about it. Teaching students the criteria for quality teaches students what to notice and provides them a vocabulary for talking about it.\n\nTeaching criteria is like teaching a foreign language-you need immersion. Surround students with the language of the criteria. Like the example of the teacher with the target on the bulletin board, provide students with pictures, examples, verbal descriptions, and models.\n\nFigure 6.3 provides a step-by-step procedure for how you can start the immersion process for quality writing criteria.\n\nGive students a copy of one of the \"Student Friendly\" versions of the rubric.

The only thing allowed on it (that we allowed) was ducks & fish. If another person or dog would even look like going near that place, Fox and I would run them off in a frenzy. There was a lot of rocks around, so I would build forts and traps for any body even daring to come near. The pond had a bridge that was shaded by willows, so on a hot day me and Fox would sit on that bridge & soak our feet, well, I would soak my feet, Fox just kinda jumped in.\n\nAt night, the pond was alive with frogs, so I would invite this kid over, (he was a guy like me) and catch frogs. After we had a couple each, we would pick the best looking one out of our group and race them. The winner gets the other guys frog.\n\nIn the winter, the pond would freeze over, and I got my iceskates out. The pond was now an ice skating rink.

I went face first into murky, shadowy waters. When I went down, a minute later I felt something pull on my shirt, I grabbed it, not knowing what to think, when I hit the surface, I saw that it was Fox, pulling on my shirt as if he was trying to save me. He was to little to save me if I was really drowning, but it was the thought that counts, I owe him one.\n\n(continued)\n\nAnother year passed. One day my mom got home from the store, and she bought me a rubber raft. It was just a cheap one, but it was mine. I blew it up with a tire pump. It was just the right size for me & Fox. Out of respect for Fox, I named it the USS Fox and christened it right in the pond.\n\nOn sunny days, I would take the raft out & lay in the sun with Fox on my legs. One day, when I was asleep in the raft, the wind blew pretty hard and blew my raft right into a bunch of sticks and rocks, the USS Fox was given a sad salute, and then was no more.\n\nAnother year passed, and this would be our last year by the pond. I admired and respected that pond more than I ever did that year. But, at long last, all good things must come to an end, we moved to another town.

Students feel overwhelmed when they have to attend to all the features of good writing at once-remember the golf example in Chapter 2.\n\nTeachers usually begin with the trait of Ideas. After all, a paper without good ideas is not worth reorganizing, improving word choice, and so on. Then, continue on to Organization, or perhaps Voice. Some teachers, however, prefer to begin with an easier trait to conceptualize, like Word Choice, in order to familiarize students with the use of criteria before moving on to more complex features of writing.\n\nSpend as much time on each trait as students need-there's always next year. Our experience shows that by Grade 6, students can internalize all six traits in a single school year (a couple of hours a week). High school students can do it in a single term (again, a couple of hours a week). Adults take about 18 hours.\n\nIn any case, Figure 6.6 shows the steps in reading and scoring anonymous papers in order to internalize each component of quality.",

What you have to remember is that even though all this information has come from many years of research and practice, it's still a continuous process oflearning about rubrics-a process in which *we all*  are still engaged! These aren't the fmal answers-they're temporary answers until we all learn more.\n\nBut it's also true that the ideas in this book-making learning targets clear to students and improving student achievement by inviting them into the assessment process-are not a flash in the pan. This is the future of assessment in education. Rubrics are a powerful means to this end.",

First, they're referenced throughout the book to illustrate points made. Second, in our experience, educators are desperate to get their hands on good ones. So, we've allocated a good portion of the book to these samples. None of these rubrics is perfect; all should be considered works in progress. Every one has some feature of interest.

    "content": "As described in the *California Mathematics Framework* (1992), mathematically powerful students are those who can draw on mathematical ideas, tools, and techniques to think and communicate. In responding to an open-ended question and accomplishing its task, a student demonstrates mathematical power. As the student engages in and responds to the task, he or she draws from his or her thinking capacity, understanding of mathematical ideas, ability to use tools and techniques, communication skills, and ability to shape a coherent and focused response.\n\nThe general rubric below is used to evaluate responses to open-ended questions in mathematics. The rubric articulates the extent to which student work accomplishes the purpose of the task and demonstrates mathematical understanding, reasoning, thinking, communicating, and use of tools and techniques. Level 6 represents the highest quality of work, and Level 1 the lower quality of performance. This rubric can be applied to any open-ended task. Therefore, before applying this rubric to mathematics assessment, the scorer must explore all possible ways in which it relates to a particular problem. In other words, the scorer looks for the mathematical ideas, thinking, communication, tools, and techniques that a student can use to solve a particular problem.\n\nLevelS: Solid work that may go beyond the requirements of the task(s), showing, for example,",

First, they loosely defined a story as a series ofrelated events or happenings.

Paper is a list of sentences minimally related or a list of sentences that all describe a single event.\n\n2. Undeveloped Story. Paper is a listing of related events. More than one event is described but with few details about setting, characters, or the event. (Usually, there is no more than one sentence telling about each event.)\n\n3. Basic Story. Paper describes a series of events, giving details (in at least two or three sentences) about some aspect of the story (the events, the characters' goals, or problems to be solved). But the story lacks cohesion because of problems with syntax, sequencing, events missing, or an undeveloped ending.\n\n4. Extended Story. Paper describes a sequence of episodes, including details about most story elements (i.e., setting, episodes, charters' goals, problems to be solved). But the stories are confusing or incomplete (i.e., at the end the characters' goals are ignored or problems inadequately resolved; the beginning does not match the rest of the story; the internal logic or plausibility of characters' actions is not maintained).\n\n5. Developed Story. Paper describes a sequence of episodes in which almost all story elements are clearly developed (i.e., setting, episodes, characters' goals, or problems to be solved) with a simple resolution of these goals or problems at the end. May have one or two problems or include too much detail.",

First, they loosely defined informative writing as the presentation of information and ideas for the purpose of informing an audience. Further, in the process of presenting information, the writer establishes relationships between pieces of information and/ or ideas. The papers were then classified according to how well the writers had succeeded in establishing relationships and according to how well they presented the information to a particular audience for a specific purpose.\n\nThe differences between Levels 1 through 4 are the degree to which the writers established relationships between the pieces of information in their papers. The difference between Levels 5 and 6 is the degree to which the writers conveyed a sense of audience and purpose. This was often accomplished through the use of an overt type of organizational structure.\n\n1 Listing. Paper lists pieces of information or ideas all on the same topic but does not relate them. A range of information/ideas is presented.\n\n2 Attempted Discussion. Paper includes several pieces of information and some range of information. In part ofthe paper, an attempt is made to relate some of the information (in a sentence or two), but relationships are not clearly established because ideas are incomplete or undeveloped (the amount of explanation and details is limited).\n\n3 Undeveloped Discussion. Paper includes a broad range of information and attempts to relate some of the pieces of information. The relationships are somewhat established but not completely.

While developing an argument by clearly stating and supporting an opinion may be considered an effective way of persuading an audience, the team felt that papers which include the recognition and refutation of an opposing viewpoint are more complex forms of persuasion. They placed the 58 persuasive papers submitted by students along a continuum of persuasive complexity, ranging from opinion to argumentation to refutation.\n\n1 Opinion. Paper is a statement of opinion, but no reasons are given to support the opinion, or the reasons given are inconsistent or unrelated to the opinion.\n\n2 Extended Opinion.

    "content": "In order to understand the rubric, you need a little context. In the booklet from which these rubrics come, the authors' premise is that innovative teaching techniques (e.g., cooperative learning, group discussions, hands-on experiments, and videos) do not guarantee a change in the \"intellectual quality\" of what students are asked to do. For example, \"a portfolio that shows a variety of student work over a semester might replace the final exam taken in one sitting, but the portfolio itself could be filled with tasks\" devoted to remembering and listing isolated bits of information. Thus, the merit of any teaching technique should be judged by its ability to improve the \"intellectual quality\" of student performance.\n\nTherefore, in the booklet, the authors attempt to define \"intellectual quality,\" and then use this definition to develop three sets of rubrics: to judge the intellectual quality of the school work students are asked to perform, the intellectual quality of assessment tasks given to students, and the intellectual quality of student work that results from the tasks.\n\nThe rubrics were pilot-tested in mathematics and social studies. The booklet includes many examples in these subjects. But since the authors encourage application to any content area, the rubrics can serve to define delivery and performance standards across the curriculum and across teaching methods. The rubrics appear to be appropriate for about Grades 6 through 12.\n\nThere are three general standards for intellectual quality:\n\na. Construction of Knowledge-The mere reproduction of knowledge is not enough. Students need to know how to use that knowledge to make their own interpretations, evaluations, analyses, and syntheses. The authors don't expect students to perform like skilled adults, but they need to develop in that direction.",

Again, the authors do not suggest that young students can be expected to make seminal contributions to the academic disciplines, but that they are capable of engaging in these forms of cognitive work when that work is adapted to students' levels of development.\n\nc. Value Beyond School-Authentic achievements have meaning or value apart from documenting the competence of the learner. Adults use their information and skills to accomplish real tasks. We should help students to do this, too.\n\nThese three standards are applied in different ways to the three sets of rubrics in the booklet. Below, we present how the authors use these three standards to develop rubrics for the \"intellectual quality\" of student work.

Scores should be based only on evidence in the student's performance relevant to the criteria. Matters such as whether the student followed directions, neatness, correct spelling, and so forth should not be considered unless they are relevant to the criteria.\n\nB. Scores may be limited by tasks which fail to demand analysis, disciplinary conceptual understanding, or elaborated written communication, but the scores must be based only upon the work shown.\n\nC. Scores should take into account what students can reasonably be expected to do at the grade level. However, scores should still be assigned only according to \"absolute\" criteria in the standards, not relative to other papers that have been previously scored.\n\nD. When it is difficult to decide between two scores (e.g., a 2 or a 3), give the higher score only when a persuasive case can be made that the paper meets minimal criteria for the higher score. If the specific wording of the criteria are not helpful in making this judgment, base the score on the general intent or spirit of the standard described in the introductory paragraphs of the standard.",

    "content": "So, what's in a word? A lot of confusion iffolks are using terminology differently. Therefore, we present the following glossary of definitions *for the terms we use in this book.* Remember that there is not 100% agreement on some of these definitions. Regardless of whether or not you like *our* definitions, it is important to establish common agreement among your colleagues on the meaning of the terms *you* use.\n\nAnalytical trait scoring-Scoring procedure in which performances are evaluated for selected traits, with each trait receiving a separate score. For example, a piece of writing may be evaluated according to organization, use of details, attention to audience, and language usage/mechanics. Trait scores may be weighted and/ or totaled. (see *Holistic* and *Primary Trait Scoring)*\n\nAnchor-Representative product or performance used to illustrate each point on a scoring scale. The top anchor is sometimes called the exemplar. (see *Criteria, Rubric,* and *Scoring guide)*\n\nAssessment-Any systematic basis for making inferences about characteristics of people, usually based on various sources of evidence; the global process of synthesizing information about individuals in order to understand and describe them better.\n\nAuthentic-Refers to assessment tasks that elicit demonstrations of knowledge and skills in ways that they are applied in the \"real world.\" An \"authentic assessment\" task is also engaging to students and reflects the best current thinking in instructional activities. Thus, teaching to the task is desirable. (see *Performance assessment* and *Task)*\n\nBias and distortion-Factors, unrelated to the skill being assessed, that interfere with a valid inference regarding a student's true ability. For example, too much reading on a mathematics test might result in a distorted vision of a student's mastery of mathematics content. (see *Reliability* and *Validity)*",

    "content": "Constructed response-Assessment questions that require a student to produce a response rather than selecting it from a list. For example, essays, reports, oral presentations, reading fluency, open-ended mathematics problems, and so forth.\n\nContent standard-Goal statement identifying the knowledge, skills, and dispositions to be developed through instruction. (see *Target)*\n\nCriteria-Guidelines, rules, or principles by which student responses, products, or performances are judged. (see *Criterion-referenced* and *Evaluation)*\n\nCriterion-referenced-Approach for describing a student's performance according to established criteria (e.g., she typed 55 words per minute without errors). (see *Criteria* and *Norm-referenced)*\n\nDispositions-Refers to the affective dimensions of students in school (e.g., motivation to learn, attitude toward school, academic self-concept, flexibility, persistence, and locus of control). Some scoring guides are designed to assess dispositions. These provide specific, observable indicators of the disposition being assessed.\n\nEvaluation-Judgment regarding the quality, value, or worth of assessment results (e.g., \"The information we collected indicates that students are reading as well as we would like\"). Evaluations are usually based on multiple sources of information. (see *Criteria)*\n\nGeneric (general) criteria-Criteria that can be used to score performance on a large number of related tasks (e.g., a mathematics rubric that can be used to score problem solving regardless of the specific content of the problem). (see *Task-specific criteria)*\n\nHolistic scoring-Scoring procedure yielding a single score based upon an overall impression of a product or performance. (see *Analytical trait scoring* and *Primary trait scoring)*\n\nNorm-referenced-Describing a student's performance by comparison to other, similar students (e.g., she typed better than 80% of her classmates).

    "content": "Performance assessment-Assessment activity that requires students to construct a response, create a product, or perform a demonstration. Since performance assessments generally do not yield a single correct answer or solution method, evaluations of student products or performances are based on judgments guided by criteria. (see *Assessment, Criteria,* and *Task)*\n\nPerformance list-Scoring guide consisting of designated criteria but without descriptive details. For example, a performance list for writing might contain six features: ideas, organization, voice, word choice, sentence fluency,and conventions. Unlike a rubric, a performance list merely provides a set of features without defining the terms or providing indicators of quality. (see *Anchor, Criteria, Rubric,* and *Scoring guide)*\n\nPerformance standard-An established level of achievement, quality of performance, or degree of proficiency. Performance standards specify how well students are expected to achieve or perform. (see *Anchor* and *Content standard)*\n\nPrimary trait scoring-Scoring procedure by which products or performances are evaluated by limiting attention to a single criterion or a few selected criteria. These criteria are based upon the trait or traits determined to be essential for a successful performance on a given task. For example, a note to a principal urging a change in a school rule might have persuasiveness as the primary trait. Scorers would attend only to that trait. (see *Analytical trait scoring* and *Holistic scoring)*\n\nReliability-Degree to which the results of an assessment are dependable and yield consistent results across raters (interrater reliability), over time (test-retest reliability), or across different versions of the same test (internal consistency or interform reliability). Technically, this is a statistical term that defines the extent to which errors of measurement are absent from an assessment instrument. (see *Bias and distortion* and *Validity)*",

    "content": "Rubric-Set of general criteria used to evaluate a student's performance in a given outcome area. Rubrics consist of a fixed measurement scale (e.g., 4 point) and a list of criteria that describe the characteristics of products or performances for each score point. Rubrics are frequently accompanied by examples (anchors) of products or performances to illustrate the various score points on the scale. (see *Anchor, Criteria, Performance list,* and *Scoring guide)*\n\nSelected response-Assessment questions that ask students to select an answer from a provided list (e.g., multiple-choice, matching, and true-false).\n\nScoring guide-Generic term for a criterion-based tool used in judging performance. In this book, we are using scoring guide synonymously with criteria and rubric. (see *Criteria, Performance list,* and *Rubric)*\n\nStandardized-Set of consistent procedures for constructing, administering, and scoring an assessment. The goal of standardization is to ensure that all students are assessed under uniform conditions so that interpretation of their performance is comparable and not influenced by differing conditions. Both norm-referenced and criterion-referenced assessments can be standardized.\n\nTask-Assessment exercise involving students in producing a response, product or performance (e.g., solving a mathematics problem, conducting a laboratory in science, or writing a paper). Since tasks are associated with performance assessments, many are complex and open-ended, requiring responses to a challenging question or problem. However, there can be simple performance tasks, such as reading aloud to measure reading rate. Tasks don't have to be exclusively used as stand-alone activities that occur at the end of instruction; teachers can observe students working on tasks during the course of regular instruction in order to provide ongoing feedback. (see *Assessment*  and *Test)*\n\nTarget (as in \"learning target\")-Statement of what we want students to know and be able to do. (see *Content standard)*",
